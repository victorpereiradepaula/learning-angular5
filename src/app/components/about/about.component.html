    <h3>About this</h3>
    <p>This page was created with the intention of learning Angular 5. Learning that framework is part of a personal project,
      know the main technologies for web development and improve my javascript, html and css skills.</p>
    <p>I'm a perfectionist, so I'm always looking for new ways to present the contents of the pages, but I'm still starting when
      it comes to design.</p>
